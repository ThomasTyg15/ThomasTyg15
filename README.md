## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an engineering student in the Paris region, pursuing a Master's degree in **Cybersecurity**.  
Alongside my studies, I work as a **Cybersecurity GRC Consultant**, where I help organizations strengthen their governance, risk, and compliance practices.  

This GitHub page is where I share some of the projects that truly inspire me â€” ranging from my academic journey to personal initiatives in the cybersecurity field.
